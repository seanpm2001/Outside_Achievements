# Outside Achievements

**TODO:** Design SVG emblems for all achievements, split up this list into multiple files, and add tens of thousands of achievements.

> **Note** no one person can obtain all of the achievements, but can go for as many as they can. Some achievements may not be accessible to some people, due to living condition dependencies, morals and ethics, and other conditions

**This list is extremely incomplete, and needs at least 500,000 more entries.**
